# Smart Grid Simulator
## About
A smart grid simulator built using Jade and JavaFX.

In this project, I simulate  a smart grid System of Systems (SoS) using agent based modelling.

Each constituent system in the smart grid SoS is represented by an agent in the Jade framework.

## How to run
1. In your IDE (Intellij), add all jar files in "JADE-all-4.5.0" and "javafx-sdk-15.0.1"
2. Add everything in "lib" to project library.
3. Run config for intellij:

## Changeable Variables Description
Found in Settings.java

    //Rate Flags
    private int rateSecsPowerGen = 1000; //in ms, power gen rate / ms
    private int rateSecsSmartHome = 1000; //in ms, power consumption rate / ms
    private int houseUnit = 100; //each smart home agent's unit size, ie, 100 means 1 smart home agent in UI = 100 smart home agents.
    private int secondsToRun = 600; //in seconds, total time for simulator to run before quitting.

    //UI Size
    private int multiplier = 2; //image size multiplier
    private int imageHeightXY = 30; //image size for powergen, power dis
    private int homeImageXY = 20; //image size for  smarthomes
    private int evImageXY = 15; //image size for evs
    private double canvasX = 1024; //windows size x
    private double canvasY = 768; //windows size y

    private boolean pauseSimulation = false; //DO NOT TOUCH, used for pause/play
    private int simCheckRate = 200; //in ms, rate at which agent checks the pause state of the world. lesser means faster 

    //Agent Flags
    private int numPowerAgents = 2; //number of power agents
    private int numPowerDisAgents = 5; //number of power distribution/storage agents
    private int numSmartHomeAgents = 5; //number of smart home agents
    private int numEVAgents = 2; //number of ev agents

    //other
    private String PORT_NAME = "7778"; //port used
    private String HOSTNAME = "localhost"; //hostname


## Simulated Entities
### Power Generator Agent
- Registers capabilities to yellow pages (DFS) for service discovery.
- Generates power and adds to power grid.
- Transfers power to nearest/next nearest Power Storage and Distribution agents when own capacity is full.
- Able to also transfer power directly to Smart Home Agents.
- Values used for power generation are stored in resources > data > netgen_10k.csv (lowest generator profile).
- At start, the values are uniformly randomly sampled from the csv file.
- Values are sourced from US Energy Information Administration.

### Power Storage and Distribution Agent
- Registers capabilities to yellow pages (DFS) for service discovery.
- Accepts power from Power Generation Agents ifff own capacity is not full. Rejects if full.
- Able to transfer power to Smart Home Agents.
- Functions as EV Charger.
- Capacities of this agent and Power Generator Agents are sourced from Form EIA-830, 3_4_Energy_Storage_Y2019, US Energy Information Administration.
- Values are stored in resources > data > storage_capacity.csv
- At start, the values are uniformly randomly sampled from the csv file.

### SmartHome Agent
- Registers capabilities to yellow pages (DFS) for service discovery.
- Each Smart Home Agent has a set of Appliances.
- Appliances are randomly sampled from a probability distribution as shown in table.
 ![table](notes/appliances_uk.png)
- Sourced from :Mansouri, I., Newborough, M., & Probert, D. (1996). Energy consumption in uk households: Impact of domestic electrical appliances. Applied Energy, 54(3 SPEC. ISS.), 211â€“285. https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-2619(96)00001-3
- Consumption levels were based on the annual usage values in the table and divided into a per hour value in kWh.

### EVAgent
- EV power capacities and power consumption rates were sourced from:
  Dixon, J., & Bell, K. (2020). Electric vehicles: Battery capacity, charger power, access to charging and the impacts on distribution networks. ETransportation, 4, 100059. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etran.2020.100059
- The consumption rate profiles ere based on the values for movement within a city as shown in the study.
- Each unit of pixel traversed by the EV represents 1km of real world distance.
- EV Charging is triggered when battery is < 30% and searches for nearest or next nearest charger. (Power Storage and Distribution Agent)
- No collision avoidance implemented yet.
- The EV Agent's travelling path is randomly generated each time.
- EV Agents will wait for charging station to have power (up to a set limit) before finding a new charger.

### UI Capabilities
- Pause and play.
- Kill agents on right click context menu > Kill.
- Agents will behave smartly (to some extent) when agents are killed.

### Sos Agent
- Only wakes power agents for now
- TODO: Calculate consumption vs generation and manage smart grid's efficiency rate as a whole.
